# Redux - Combined Reducers

## Using combineReducers

The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing "slices" of domain-specific data at each top-level key. Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have "slice reducer" functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state. Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.

Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.

### combineReducers
 takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs a corresponding state object with the same keys. This means that if no preloaded state is provided to createStore, the naming of the keys in the input slice reducer object will define the naming of the keys in the output state object. The correlation between these names is not always apparent, especially when using ES6 features such as default module exports and object literal shorthands.

Here's an example of how use of ES6 object literal shorthand with combineReducers can define the state shape:

```
// reducers.js
export default theDefaultReducer = (state = 0, action) => state

export const firstNamedReducer = (state = 1, action) => state

export const secondNamedReducer = (state = 2, action) => state

// rootReducer.js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'

import theDefaultReducer, {
  firstNamedReducer,
  secondNamedReducer
} from './reducers'

// Use ES6 object literal shorthand syntax to define the object shape
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  theDefaultReducer,
  firstNamedReducer,
  secondNamedReducer
})

const store = createStore(rootReducer)
console.log(store.getState())
// {theDefaultReducer : 0, firstNamedReducer : 1, secondNamedReducer : 2}
```
## combineReducers(reducers)

As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.

The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by `combineReducers()` namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to `combineReducers()`

Example:

```
rootReducer = combineReducers({potato: potatoReducer, tomato: tomatoReducer})
// This would produce the following state object
{
  potato: {
    // ... potatoes, and other state managed by the potatoReducer ...
  },
  tomato: {
    // ... tomatoes, and other state managed by the tomatoReducer, maybe some nice sauce? ...
  }
}
```

You can control state key names by using different keys for the reducers in the passed object. For example, you may call `combineReducers({ todos: myTodosReducer, counter: myCounterReducer })` for the state shape to be `{ todos, counter }`.

A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: `combineReducers({ counter, todos })`. This is equivalent to writing `combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos })`.

* A Note for Flux Users
This function helps you organize your reducers to manage their own slices of state, similar to how you would have different Flux Stores to manage different state. With Redux, there is just one store, but combineReducers helps you keep the same logical division between reducers.

### Arguments
reducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.
Earlier documentation suggested the use of the ES6 import * as reducers syntax to obtain the reducers object. This was the source of a lot of confusion, which is why we now recommend exporting a single reducer obtained using combineReducers() from reducers/index.js instead. An example is included below.

---

### Returns
(Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape.

---

### Notes
This function is mildly opinionated and is skewed towards helping beginners avoid common pitfalls. This is why it attempts to enforce some rules that you don't have to follow if you write the root reducer manually.

Any reducer passed to combineReducers must satisfy these rules:

For any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument.

It must never return undefined. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early return statement, so combineReducers throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.

If the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.

While combineReducers attempts to check that your reducers conform to some of these rules, you should remember them, and do your best to follow them. combineReducers will check your reducers by passing undefined to them; this is done even if you specify initial state to Redux.createStore(combineReducers(...), initialState). Therefore, you must ensure your reducers work properly when receiving undefined as state, even if you never intend for them to actually receive undefined in your own code.

* Example

`reducers/todos.js`

```
export default function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return state.concat([action.text])
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

`reducers/counter.js`
```
export default function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

`reducers/index.js`

```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import todos from './todos'
import counter from './counter'

export default combineReducers({
  todos,
  counter
})

```

`App.js`
```
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import reducer from './reducers/index'

const store = createStore(reducer)
console.log(store.getState())
// {
//   counter: 0,
//   todos: []
// }

store.dispatch({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  text: 'Use Redux'
})
console.log(store.getState())
// {
//   counter: 0,
//   todos: [ 'Use Redux' ]
// }
```
---

### Tips

This helper is just a convenience! You can write your own combineReducers that works differently, or even assemble the state object from the child reducers manually and write a root reducing function explicitly, like you would write any other function.

You may call combineReducers at any level of the reducer hierarchy. It doesn't have to happen at the top. In fact you may use it again to split the child reducers that get too complicated into independent grandchildren, and so on.
