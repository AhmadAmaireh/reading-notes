## What is a Linked List
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Types of Linked Lists
Singly: Singly refers to the number of references the node A has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly: Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

Multiply Linked List: In a multiply linked list, each node consists of two or more link fields. Each field is used to join the same set of records in a different order of the same set.

Circular Linked List:A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.


## Advantage of Linked Lists
Nodes can easily be removed or added from a linked list without reorganizing the entire data structure. This is one advantage it has over arrays.

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists
Search operations are slow in linked lists. Unlike arrays, random access of data elements is not allowed. Nodes are accessed sequentially starting from the first node. It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage of the pointers.
## Important Notes of Linked Lists
The way to traverse through a linked list is by using (while()) loop
Traversing linked list has Big O of time = O(n) and Big O of space = O(1)

Adding Nodes can be done in the begining of the linked list with Add() method and in the middle of it by AddBefor()or AddAfter() methods

Linked lists can be linear structured (traversed sequentially) and non-linear structured (traversed non-sequentially)

Linked lists don't need to be continuous in memory(as arrays), they can grow dynamically

## Parts of linked lists
Head is The starting point of the list and the end of the list isnâ€™t a node, but rather a node that points to null, or an empty value

## Each single node must have two element
DATA: The information that the node contains.
NEXT: reference to the next node.

## The properties of the linked list data structure
SIZE: The number of elements in the linked list.
HEAD: The first element in the linked list.
TAIL: The last element in the linked list.

## The main operations of a linked list data structure are
insertAt: Inserts an element at the specific index.
removeAt: Removes the element at the specific index.
getAt: Retrieves the element at the specific index.
clear: Empties the linked list.
reverse: Reverses the order of elements in the linked list.
